                My name is Sheyla Ortiz, and I like to learn new things and fix things. I like going on hikes, swimming, playing with my dogs and doing yoga. Occationaly I like watching some good tv shows and movies.

             <p>
            I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and was raised in the island until I was 15. My parents move to the United States to get a better job opportunity and we ended up leaving Puerto Rico in 2001. I graduated High School and moved back to Puerto Rico to study and work.

            I came back to the United States in 2012 to San Antonio Texas, and started working at a Hotel for a year and then decided I was ready for a change. I moved to Austin Texas in 2013 and have stayed here ever since
